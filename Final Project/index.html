    <h3>Latinx Populations in New York City Neighborhoods</h3>
    <h2>Final Project | Tania Goicoechea</h2>
    <h4>Latinxs are the second largest racial/ethnic demographic group in New York City, but they are not distributed equally across New York City neightborhoods. 
      Furthermore, many live in climate sensitive parts of the city that are prone to flooding and to the negative effects of heat in the summer. Research shows that 
      Latinxs respond better to climate messaging in their native language, so it is important to have educational programs in English and in Spanish. Knowing where
      people live can help target important information and messaging to prepare for emergencies and to build climate resilience. The map below allows users to 
      explore New York City neighborhoods and the percentage of Latinxs that live in each of them.
